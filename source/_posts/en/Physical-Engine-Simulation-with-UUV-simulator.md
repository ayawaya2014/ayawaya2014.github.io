It is a good idea to use UUV-simulator for control simulations of Unmanned Underwater Vehicles.

MAC3 and Casadi control optimizaiton tools are used to apply PID and none model based [sliding mode control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04264v2). 

The Framework is based on ROS, mainly in  C++ and Python.

Matlab can be combined with ROS, as well as V-rep simulation software.

SOM method can also be used for tracking of multiple coexisting trajectories for autonomous underwater vehicles.

Dubins path planner can be used for AUV formation tracking.
