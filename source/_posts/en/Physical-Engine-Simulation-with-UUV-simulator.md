It is a good idea to use UUV-simulator for control simulations of Unmanned Underwater Vehicles.

MAC3 and Casadi control optimizaiton tools are used to apply PID and none model based sliding mode control, with C++ and Python. 

In the furture, Matlab can be combined, as well as V-rep simulation software.

SOM method can also be used for tracking of multiple coexisting trajectories for autonomous underwater vehicles.

Dubins path planner can be used for AUV formation tracking.
