# About me

<img src="/images/photo.lx.github.io.jpg" class="floatpic" width="300" height="360">
My name is Xin Li. I am now a faculty member at Shanghai Maritime University. I am interested in machine learning, robotics, and artificial neural networks, etc. 
<!-- ![photo_1](/images/photo.jpg) -->

<!--and deep learning based algorithms, -->

## Education background

I received the B.S. degree in information engineering from Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China, in 2007, and the M.S. degree in signal and information processing and the Ph.D. degree in power electronics and power transmission from Shanghai Maritime University, Shanghai, China, in 2010 and 2018, respectively. 

<!-- I am currently working toward the Ph.D. degree  in the Laboratory of Underwater Vehicles and Intelligent systems, Shanghai Maritime University, under the supervision of Prof. D. Zhu. -->

## Research interests

- Neural Networks and Machine Learning 
Advanced algorithms based on neural networks and machine learning to deal with real-world applications.

- Control of Underwater Vehicles
Path planning, multi-task assignment, formation control, fault tolerence, etc. 
Electronical control units. 
Simulations of AUVs and UUVs. 
Physical test platforms. 
Underwater image & video processing.

<!-- 
- Neural Networks and Deep Learning 
We develop new algorithms based on neural networks and deep learning to deal with control and pattern recognition problems, mainly for the underwater vehicles.
